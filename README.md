Comparison of ML algorithm on Titanic Dataset

In this challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we are asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Algorithms are compared on the basis of Train Accuracy,Test Accuracy and Precision score.

Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib have been used.

Final prediction has scored 0.79904 on kaggle and it ranked in top 16%.
